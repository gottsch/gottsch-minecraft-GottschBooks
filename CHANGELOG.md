# Changelog for Gottsch Books for Forge 1.20.1

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Project skeleton.
- `gottschbooks:book` datapack registry (`data/<ns>/gottschbooks/book/<book>.json`, `{}` or `{"disabled": true}`),
  and book tags (`data/<ns>/tags/gottschbooks/book/<tag>.json`).
- `gottschbooks:book` stack NBT (a string): which book a stack is.
- `gottschbooks:read_books` in the player's persisted data: the books a player has read, kept through death.
- `gottschbooks:book_read` advancement trigger, with optional `book`, `books` (`#tag`, every book in it) and
  `all_in` (every book in a namespace) conditions.
- Illustration providers: `Illustrations.register(scheme, provider)` for `![caption](scheme:ns:id)`; `item` built in.
- `Books`: the common API (stack id, read tracking).
- Lore-book reader (moved from Magic Treasures): the book flows onto as many pages as the window needs, one or two
  pages at a time, with a title page, ornaments between sections, illustrations and editor's notes. Opened with
  `GottschBooksClient.open(book, icon)` or by right-clicking a `BookItem`.
- Book files: `assets/<ns>/books/<book>/<locale>/text.md`, falling back to `en_us`; optional
  `assets/<ns>/books/<book>/book.md` with `skin: <ns>:<folder>` for the book's own `cover.png`, `page.png` and
  `ornament.png`. Resource packs can replace any of them.
- Markdown subset: front matter (`title`, `author`), paragraphs, hard breaks, `*italic*`, `**bold**`,
  `{gold}colour{}` / `{#d4a017}colour{}`, `#` headings, `---` ornaments, `>` notes, `![caption](scheme:ns:id)`
  illustrations and `<!-- page -->` page breaks. Anything else is shown as plain text.
